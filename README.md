# Notes for CSS Styling:

### UI/UX

#### ✅ More than two items marked incomplete in this section will require you to use your one redo to re-submit them. If two or fewer items are marked incomplete, the project is considered passing. Your group’s front-end app must fulfill the below requirements.

- [x] Colors used in the app have appropriate contrast that meet the [WCAG 2.0 level AA standard](https://www.wcag.com) | [The site itself](https://www.wcag.com/resource/what-is-wcag/).
- [x] Only the user who created a piece of data can see and interact with the UI for editing or deleting that data.
- [ ] When editing an item, the form is pre-filled with that item’s details.
