# Notes for myself:

### UI/UX

#### ✅ More than two items marked incomplete in this section will require you to use your one redo to re-submit them. If two or fewer items are marked incomplete, the project is considered passing. Your group’s front-end app must fulfill the below requirements.

- [ ] All buttons are styled.
- [ ] All images have alt text.
- [ ] Colors used in the app have appropriate contrast that meet the [WCAG 2.0 level AA standard](https://www.wcag.com) | [The site itself](https://www.wcag.com/resource/what-is-wcag/).
- [ ] No text is placed on top of an image in a way that makes the text inaccessible.
- [ ] Only the user who created a piece of data can see and interact with the UI for editing or deleting that data.
- [ ] The app exhibits a visual theme, like a consistent color palette and cohesive layout across pages.
- [ ] The app is easily navigable by a first-time user. For example, navigation should be done through links instead of having to type in a URL to navigate around the app.
- [ ] The app utilizes CSS _Flexbox_ and/or **Grid** for page layout design.
- [ ] When editing an item, the form is pre-filled with that item’s details.
